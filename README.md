<i><b> Documents </b><i> folder contains a document with sensor description, serial monitor and plotter image, real time applications, code, input, output and result for each sensor present in this repository

## <b><i> Accelerometer Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>An accelerometer is an electronic sensor that measures the acceleration forces acting on
an object, in order to determine the object’s position in space and monitor the object’s
movement. Acceleration, which is a vector quantity, is the rate of change of an object’s
velocity</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>To detect and monitor vibrations in rotating machinery.
<li>To display images in an upright position on screens of digital cameras.
<li>Accelerometers are used to sense orientation, coordinate acceleration, vibration,
shock.
</p>

## <b><i> Ambient Light Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>Ambient light sensor is just another analog sensor. It is compatible with micro-controllers which supports analog data input. This sensor is working like a transistor. As light falling on sensor increases the analog output(SIGNAL) will increase. An ambient light sensor is a component in smartphones,notebooks , other mobile devices and LCD TVs. It is a photodetector that is used to sense the amount of ambient light present and appropriately dim the device screen to match it.</p>


<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>Ambient light sensors are also called illuminance or illu- mination sensors, optical sensors, brightness sensors or simply light sensors.
<li>One very important application for ALS technology is cell phones.In a cell phone, the ALS enables automatic control of display backlight brightness over a wide range of illumination conditions from a dark environment to direct sunlight.With the ALS input, a microcontroller (MCU) or baseband processor increases or decreases the display brightness depending on the environment.This control dramatically improves visibility and reduces power consumption since LCD backlight- ing can draw as much as 51% of the power in the input standby mode

## <b><i> Analog Sound Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>An sound sensor is an instrument that detects the loudness in the environment by imitating the input interface. It detects sound waves through its intensity and converting it to electrical signals. Analog sound sensor consists of an inbuilt capacitive microphone, peak detector and an amplifier. With these components, it allows the sound waves propagate through air molecules. Such sound waves cause the diaphragm in the microphone to vibrate, resulting in capacitance change. Capacitance change is then amplified and digitalized for processing of sound
intensity</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>Sensor can be used in consumer electronics such as phones, computers, music
systems.
<li>They are also used in Security and Monitoring systems such as burglar alarms,
door alarm,etc.
</p>

## <b><i> Gas Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>A gas sensor is a device that senses the atmosphere's presence or
concentration of gases. The sensor creates a corresponding potential difference
depending on the concentration of the gas by adjusting the resistance of the
material within the sensor, which can be determined as the output voltage.</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>Gas sensor are employed in factories and manufacturing facilities to
identify gas leaks, and to detect smoke and carbon monoxide in homes.
<li>Gas sensors are electronic devices that detect and identify different types
of gases. The are commonly used to detect toxic or explosive gasses and
measure gas concentration.</p>

## <b><i> Greyscale Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>The gray scale sensor is able to measure the intensity of light from black to white. A gray scale is also known as black-and-white, and is composed exclusively of shades of gray, varying from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest.</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>Grayscale is used for assessing the color shading in between products and the customer's approval sample or among pieces in production.
</p>

## <b><i> Joystick Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>The joystick has two potentiometer to read user's input. One potentiometer is
used to get the analog output voltage for X-Direction movement and the other
potentiometer is used to get the analog output voltage for Y-Direction movement.
The potentiometer are connected between +VCC and Ground.</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p><li>An analog stick is often used to move some game object, usually the playable
character.
<li>It may also be used to rotate the camera, usually around the character</p>

## <b><i> Steam Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>Steam sensor can be connected to the Arduino IO Expansion shield directly. The output
voltage will increase when the humidity of the sensor surface goes up.These sensors must be kept away from water, just vapour.</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>The steam sensor acts as a simple rain detector.
<li>In industries, the steam sensor is used as a cheap steam level switch to
detect the steam level.
<li>This sensor acts as a touch sensor based on humidit</p>

## <b><i> Ultrasonic Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or 1” to 13 feet.The operation is not affected by sunlight or black material, although acoustically, soft materials like cloth can be difficult to detect. It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver module.
</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>People detection for counting.
<li>Vehicle detection for car wash and automotive assembly.
<li>Irregular parts detection for hoppers and feeder bowls.
