## <b><i> Ambient Light Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>Ambient light sensor is just another analog sensor. It is compatible with micro-controllers which supports analog data input. This sensor is working like a transistor. As light falling on sensor increases the analog output(SIGNAL) will increase. An ambient light sensor is a component in smartphones,notebooks , other mobile devices and LCD TVs. It is a photodetector that is used to sense the amount of ambient light present and appropriately dim the device screen to match it.</p>


<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>Ambient light sensors are also called illuminance or illu- mination sensors, optical sensors, brightness sensors or simply light sensors.
<li>One very important application for ALS technology is cell phones.In a cell phone, the ALS enables automatic control of display backlight brightness over a wide range of illumination conditions from a dark environment to direct sunlight.With the ALS input, a microcontroller (MCU) or baseband processor increases or decreases the display brightness depending on the environment.This control dramatically improves visibility and reduces power consumption since LCD backlight- ing can draw as much as 51% of the power in the input standby mode

## <b><i> Analog Sound Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>An sound sensor is an instrument that detects the loudness in the environment by imitating the input interface. It detects sound waves through its intensity and converting it to electrical signals. Analog sound sensor consists of an inbuilt capacitive microphone, peak detector and an amplifier. With these components, it allows the sound waves propagate through air molecules. Such sound waves cause the diaphragm in the microphone to vibrate, resulting in capacitance change. Capacitance change is then amplified and digitalized for processing of sound
intensity</p>

<b>Real Time Applications : </b>
<p>
<li>Sensor can be used in consumer electronics such as phones, computers, music
systems.
<li>They are also used in Security and Monitoring systems such as burglar alarms,
door alarm,etc.

## <b><i> Ultrasonic Sensor </i></b>

<b>Description : </b>
<p>The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or 1‚Äù to 13 feet.The operation is not affected by sunlight or black material, although acoustically, soft materials like cloth can be difficult to detect. It comes complete with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver module.

<li>People detection for counting.
<li>Vehicle detection for car wash and automotive assembly.
<li>Irregular parts detection for hoppers and feeder bowls.
